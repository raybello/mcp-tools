00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:5,680 
 Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. 

2 
00:00:5,680 --> 00:00:7,440 
 I'm Amy Goodman. 

3 
00:00:7,440 --> 00:00:12,080 
 President Trump and senior administration officials are pushing back on a leaked U.S. 

4 
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,760 
 intelligence report that suggests the U.S. strikes on Iran only set back Iran's nuclear 

5 
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,980 
 program by a few months. 

6 
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,360 
 On Wednesday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi 

7 
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,920 
 Gabbard both insisted the strikes severely damaged Iran's nuclear program. 

8 
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,800 
 In response to the leak, the White House has announced plans to limit sharing classified 

9 
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,920 
 information with Congress. 

10 
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,240 
 Earlier today, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a new video statement 

11 
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,200 
 claiming victory over Israel and the U.S. while vowing Iran will never surrender. 

12 
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:59,640 
 First, I would like to congratulate them for victory over the fake regime of the Zionist 

13 
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:2,120 
 regime. 

14 
00:01:2,120 --> 00:01:13,980 
 With all those claims that the Zionist regime were making, they almost were crashed under 

15 
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,960 
 the blows of the Islamic government. 

16 
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840 
 They were Khamenei's first public comments in over a week. 

17 
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,480 
 Meanwhile, Iran's parliament has unanimously agreed to suspend all cooperation with the 

18 
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,480 
 IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, following the U.S. and Israeli attacks that 

19 
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,760 
 killed at least 950 Iranians, according to one count. 

20 
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,720 
 This is the speaker of the Iranian parliament. 

21 
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,000 
 Despite the recent attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, the International Atomic Energy 

22 
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,120 
 Agency has not condemned them, not even superficially. 

23 
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,840 
 It has undermined the agency's international credibility, and for this reason, the Atomic 

24 
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,840 
 Energy Organization of Iran is suspending its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy 

25 
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:5,860 
 Agency until the security of its nuclear facilities is guaranteed and Iran's peaceful nuclear 

26 
00:02:5,860 --> 00:02:9,040 
 program will proceed at a faster pace. 

27 
00:02:9,040 --> 00:02:14,180 
 In other developments on Iran, Iranian state media reports authorities have arrested more 

28 
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,900 
 than 700 people accused of having ties with Israel. 

29 
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,020 
 At least three people were executed on Wednesday for allegedly collaborating with Israel. 

30 
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,860 
 Officials in Gaza say Israeli forces have killed another 90 Palestinians over the last 24 hours, 

31 
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,220 
 including dozens waiting near new food distribution centers. 

32 
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,580 
 Israeli forces have killed over 550 people trying to access food aid over the past four 

33 
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580 
 weeks. 

34 
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,620 
 Authorities have described the aid sites as death traps. 

35 
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,620 
 We trusted the occupation soldiers after they told us to take the package. 

36 
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,620 
 I walked past the tank and picked up the package, and suddenly they started shooting directly 

37 
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620 
 at us. 

38 
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900 
 The young men were ambushed and fell to the ground. 

39 
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:0,820 
 Some were shot in the head, some in the feet. 

40 
00:03:0,820 --> 00:03:7,700 
 In other news from Gaza, seven Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday when an explosive device 

41 
00:03:7,700 --> 00:03:10,020 
 was planted on their armored vehicle. 

42 
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,980 
 It was the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in Gaza in months. 

43 
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,380 
 Meanwhile, Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, is calling on 

44 
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,380 
 Israel to halt all humanitarian aid into Gaza, despite warnings from the U.N. that the entire 

45 
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,180 
 population of Gaza is at risk of famine. 

46 
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,700 
 In the occupied West Bank, dozens of Israeli settlers attacked the town of Kafr Malik on 

47 
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,860 
 Wednesday, setting homes and vehicles on fire in an attack that culminated in Israeli soldiers 

48 
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,580 
 killing three Palestinians. 

49 
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,140 
 Officials in the West Bank said the settlers were acting under the protection of the Israeli 

50 
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140 
 army. 

51 
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,740 
 Meanwhile, Israeli forces fatally shot a 15-year-old Palestinian boy during a raid on al-Yamun. 

52 
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:1,560 
 Meanwhile, President Trump's called for the immediate cancellation of Israeli Prime Minister 

53 
00:04:1,560 --> 00:04:7,840 
 Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial in Israel, which is set to resume on Monday. 

54 
00:04:7,840 --> 00:04:13,800 
 In a rambling social media post, Trump condemned the case against Netanyahu as a witch hunt 

55 
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,920 
 and called for Netanyahu to be pardoned. 

56 
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,520 
 On Capitol Hill, some Republican senators are continuing to hold up President Trump's 

57 
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,960 
 budget bill over its proposed deep cuts to Medicaid. 

58 
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,160 
 According to the Congressional Budget Office, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act would 

59 
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,120 
 slash Medicaid spending by nearly $800 billion over a decade, eliminating health insurance 

60 
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,760 
 for some 10 million people. 

61 
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,360 
 On Wednesday, Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins rejected a proposal to create a $15 

62 
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,720 
 billion relief fund for rural hospitals, saying it failed to make up for far greater cuts. 

63 
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:0,940 
 Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Josh Hawley have also expressed skepticism. 

64 
00:05:0,940 --> 00:05:3,840 
 Senate Democrats continue to condemn the budget bill. 

65 
00:05:3,840 --> 00:05:7,000 
 This is Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. 

66 
00:05:7,000 --> 00:05:14,920 
 What this bill represents is the biggest transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class 

67 
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,080 
 to the rich in the history of the country. 

68 
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080 
 Shame. 

69 
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080 
 Shame. 

70 
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,120 
 Who's asking for that, besides the billionaires and the corporations? 

71 
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,880 
 Grassroots groups representing poor and working families rallied on Capitol Hill Wednesday 

72 
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,160 
 to demand no cuts to essential social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 

73 
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,840 
 This is Sarita Russell of the North Carolina activist group Action NC, whose family recently 

74 
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:50,480 
 saw monthly food assistance benefits slashed from $440 a month to just $54 a month. 

75 
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,560 
 Our churches, which already struggles to keep their food pantries stocked, will be 

76 
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:1,080 
 overwhelmed as more families turn to them for help. 

77 
00:06:1,080 --> 00:06:8,920 
 Our schools will see more children coming to class hungry, unable to focus on learning. 

78 
00:06:8,920 --> 00:06:15,760 
 Our homelessness population will grow more as families are forced to choose between rent 

79 
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760 
 or food. 

80 
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000 
 That ain't right. 

81 
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,280 
 The Trump administration said Wednesday it would relocate the Department of Housing and 

82 
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,560 
 Urban Development, HUD, outside of Washington, D.C., and into the headquarters of the National 

83 
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,800 
 Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia. 

84 
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,760 
 The move will force some 1,800 NSF workers to relocate to new offices. 

85 
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,440 
 The American Federation of Government Employees condemned the move, writing, quote, "'NSF 

86 
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,360 
 employees are being displaced with no plan, no communication and no respect,' unquote. 

87 
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,240 
 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has withdrawn a U.S. pledge 

88 
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,980 
 to fund the world's preeminent international vaccine organization as the Trump administration 

89 
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:1,920 
 takes its campaign against vaccinations global. 

90 
00:07:1,920 --> 00:07:7,800 
 RFK Jr. claimed the organization, known as GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has, quote, "'ignored 

91 
00:07:7,800 --> 00:07:9,880 
 the science of vaccinating children.'" 

92 
00:07:9,880 --> 00:07:15,040 
 GAVI says it's helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in dozens of lower-income 

93 
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,240 
 countries, preventing nearly 19 million future deaths. 

94 
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,760 
 On Wednesday, scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rallied 

95 
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,720 
 outside the agency's headquarters in Atlanta to protest the Trump administration's newly 

96 
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,920 
 reconstituted Vaccine Advisory Panel, which RFK Jr. stacked with unqualified appointees, 

97 
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,280 
 many of them holding anti-vaccine views. 

98 
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,000 
 This is Dr. Jody Guest, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University. 

99 
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,100 
 Science should serve the public, not politics. 

100 
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,000 
 That public health is a right, not a luxury. 

101 
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,820 
 And that people inside the agency must be allowed to do their work freely, transparently and 

102 
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820 
 without fear. 

103 
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,880 
 The stakes have never been higher. 

104 
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:1,840 
 We all know vaccines save lives. 

105 
00:08:1,840 --> 00:08:5,480 
 Science protects communities, and public health is worth fighting for. 

106 
00:08:5,760 --> 00:08:9,680 
 Later in the broadcast, we'll speak with Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education 

107 
00:08:9,680 --> 00:08:14,240 
 Center, author of numerous books, including Deadly Choices—How the Anti-Vaccine Movement 

108 
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,360 
 Threatens Us All. 

109 
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,320 
 In immigration news, the Trump administration is planning to reject refugee status for potentially 

110 
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,720 
 hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in the United States, making them immediately 

111 
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,800 
 deportable as part of Trump's sweeping mass deportation efforts. 

112 
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,200 
 That's according to CNN, which reports Trump's plan to fast-track deportations is aimed at 

113 
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,320 
 immigrants who entered the U.S. outside an official port of entry and later applied for 

114 
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320 
 asylum. 

115 
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,340 
 New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges 

116 
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,480 
 she assaulted an immigration officer during an official visit to a Newark ICE jail last 

117 
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480 
 month. 

118 
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,440 
 The charges stem from a May 9th incident in which Congressmember McIver and two other 

119 
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:3,320 
 Democratic representatives sought to tour Delaney Hall, a private prison run by Geo Corporation 

120 
00:09:3,320 --> 00:09:5,080 
 under contract with ICE. 

121 
00:09:5,080 --> 00:09:10,200 
 A criminal complaint brought by President Trump's former personal attorney, Elina Hubba, 

122 
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,120 
 who's now serving as an interim federal attorney in New Jersey, accuses Congresswoman McIver 

123 
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320 
 of slamming a federal agent with her forearm, forcibly grabbing him and striking another 

124 
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320 
 agent. 

125 
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,520 
 McIver insists she was the one roughed up by federal officers. 

126 
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,320 
 She spoke to supporters following her arraignment Wednesday at a federal courthouse in Newark. 

127 
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320 
 This is all about political intimidation. 

128 
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:37,000 
 The Trump administration and his—you know, him and his colleagues or ponies, whatever 

129 
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,640 
 you want to call them, have weaponized the federal government. 

130 
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,960 
 The facts are on our side. 

131 
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,040 
 No matter what headline they tweet about, no matter what they put on their Twitter, 

132 
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,480 
 we know that the facts are on my side. 

133 
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,360 
 Mayor Ross Baraka of Newark was also charged, but the charges have been dropped against him. 

134 
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:1,360 
 The three Congress members were trying to protect him. 

135 
00:10:1,360 --> 00:10:5,720 
 A former Justice Department lawyer has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging principal 

136 
00:10:5,720 --> 00:10:10,920 
 associate deputy attorney general Emil Bovey conspired with other top officials on how 

137 
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,560 
 to mislead courts about mass deportations and to potentially ignore judges' rulings 

138 
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560 
 outright. 

139 
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,560 
 The complaint was filed by lawyer Erez Reveni, who was fired in April after he admitted to 

140 
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,500 
 a judge the Trump administration had mistakenly transferred Maryland father, Quilmar Barrego 

141 
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,260 
 Garcia, to El Salvador's mega-prison due to a, quote, administrative error. 

142 
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,220 
 Reveni filed the complaint ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings Wednesday for Bovey 

143 
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,420 
 to serve as a judge on the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 

144 
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,580 
 This is Bovey under questioning from California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. 

145 
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,420 
 Did you suggest, as Mr. Reveni wrote, that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts 

146 
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,700 
 to f— you and ignore any such court order? 

147 
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:0,300 
 I did not suggest that there would be any need to consider ignoring court orders. 

148 
00:11:0,300 --> 00:11:3,340 
 At the point of that meeting, there were no court orders to discuss. 

149 
00:11:3,340 --> 00:11:8,420 
 Well, did you suggest telling the courts to f— you in any manner? 

150 
00:11:8,420 --> 00:11:9,780 
 I don't recall. 

151 
00:11:9,780 --> 00:11:12,740 
 You just don't remember that? 

152 
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,700 
 And one of the world's richest men faced a wave of wedding crashers as activists in 

153 
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,900 
 the Canal City of Venice disrupted Jeff Bezos' nuptials this week to protest what they call 

154 
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,620 
 Bezos' takeover of the famed city. 

155 
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,420 
 Guests at the multimillion-dollar wedding between Bezos and former TV news anchor Lauren 

156 
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,420 
 Sanchez include the Clintons, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner.

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,980 
 On Monday, activists unfurled a giant banner on Venice's San Marco Square, reading, 

158 
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,620 
 If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax. 

159 
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,700 
 This is Simona Abate, a campaigner with Greenpeace Italy. 

160 
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,300 
 The problem is not the wedding. 

161 
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,380 
 The problem is the system. 

162 
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:0,860 
 We think that one big billionaire can't rent a city for his pleasure. 

163 
00:12:0,860 --> 00:12:7,500 
 We think that we need to tax the people that have a big—a huge number of money and use 

164 
00:12:7,500 --> 00:12:14,540 
 this money for—reduce the impact of climate change, to increase the healthcare system, 

165 
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,580 
 to increase the welfare state. 

166 
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,940 
 And those are some of the headlines. 

167 
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,060 
 This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. 

168 
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,340 
 I'm Amy Goodman. 

169 
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,540 
 And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,140
