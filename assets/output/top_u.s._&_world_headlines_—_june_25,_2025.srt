00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:5,440 
 Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. 

2 
00:00:5,440 --> 00:00:6,440 
 I'm Amy Goodman. 

3 
00:00:6,440 --> 00:00:11,600 
 A classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded U.S. airstrikes on Iran 

4 
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,680 
 ordered by President Trump failed to collapse Iran's nuclear facilities buried deep underground. 

5 
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,800 
 That's according to three sources familiar with the report, who say the Pentagon assessed 

6 
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,840 
 Trump's attacks only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, rather than the total obliteration 

7 
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,620 
 claimed by the president. 

8 
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,200 
 Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected the DIA's findings, but on Tuesday, the Trump 

9 
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,960 
 administration canceled congressional intelligence briefings on the Iran attack, prompting frustration 

10 
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,560 
 from both Republicans and Democrats. 

11 
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,200 
 Illinois Democrat Mike Quigley told The Washington Post, quote, "'They don't delay briefings 

12 
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160 
 that have good news,' unquote." 

13 
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,280 
 In Gaza, Al Jazeera reports at least 41 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since 

14 
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:2,160 
 midnight, including more Palestinians targeted by Israeli forces while seeking food and 

15 
00:01:2,160 --> 00:01:3,840 
 humanitarian aid. 

16 
00:01:3,840 --> 00:01:9,600 
 This comes as Israel's issued new forced displacement orders for northern Gaza. 

17 
00:01:9,600 --> 00:01:13,280 
 Palestinians say there's no safe place left for them to go. 

18 
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,960 
 We are scared and terrified by these new and repeated Israeli threats that have been ongoing 

19 
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,520 
 since the start of this war, ordering us to go to the south of the Strip, but there is 

20 
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,720 
 no safe area that we can go to. 

21 
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,120 
 At this stage, we prefer to die where we are, rather than leave the north of the Strip 

22 
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120 
 for the south. 

23 
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,420 
 Israel's repeated targeting of Palestinians seeking aid also comes as the Trump administration 

24 
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,680 
 has approved $30 million in funding for the new shadowy U.S. and Israeli-backed aid operation, 

25 
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,520 
 the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by private contracting firms 

26 
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,500 
 led by former U.S. intelligence and military officers. 

27 
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,620 
 In Ukraine, a barrage of Russian missiles struck in and around the southeastern city 

28 
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:4,540 
 of Dnipro on Tuesday, killing at least 19 people, injuring more than 270, including children. 

29 
00:02:4,540 --> 00:02:9,580 
 It was among the deadliest attacks on Ukraine since Russia's invasion, causing extensive 

30 
00:02:9,580 --> 00:02:15,860 
 damage to schools, a cathedral, a sports arena, a music venue and eight medical centers, along 

31 
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,460 
 with residences and even a passenger train. 

32 
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,020 
 Tuesday's attack came just one day after Russian strikes on the capital, Kyiv, killed 

33 
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,580 
 nine people and wounded more than 30 others. 

34 
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,060 
 Russia's stepped-up violence came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the 

35 
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,340 
 NATO summit in The Hague, where he is set to meet today with President Trump and other 

36 
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,700 
 NATO leaders. 

37 
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,340 
 President Trump has shared personal messages from NATO Chief Mark Rutte, praising his decisive 

38 
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,960 
 action against Iran's nuclear program and claiming U.S. strikes were not a violation 

39 
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,180 
 of international law. 

40 
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,580 
 NATO nations have widely condemned the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, which U.N. 

41 
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,860 
 Secretary-General António Guterres says will cause, quote, "'serious damage' to 

42 
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:2,620 
 the international order," unquote. 

43 
00:03:2,620 --> 00:03:8,180 
 On Tuesday, Rutte welcomed leaders of NATO's 32 member nations to a summit in The Hague, 

44 
00:03:8,180 --> 00:03:13,620 
 where he echoed President Trump's call for a radical increase in military spending. 

45 
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,060 
 The defense investment plan that allies will agree in The Hague introduces a new baseline, 

46 
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,420 
 5 percent of GDP, to be invested in defense. 

47 
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,620 
 This is a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic and fundamental to securing our future. 

48 
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,380 
 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called NATO's 5 percent target unreasonable, said 

49 
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,340 
 Spain would hold its military spending at just over 2 percent of gross domestic product. 

50 
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,300 
 Meanwhile, protests are growing among citizens of NATO member nations. 

51 
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,860 
 On Tuesday, demonstrators marched through Slovenia's capital to oppose NATO expansion. 

52 
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,460 
 This means for us that the remnants of Social Security that we still have, from kindergartens 

53 
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:1,460 
 and schools to the collapsing health system and now pension reform, all of this will continue 

54 
00:04:1,460 --> 00:04:6,500 
 to be eaten away at, supposedly because we would rather give it to militarization. 

55 
00:04:6,500 --> 00:04:11,280 
 Here in New York, in a stunning victory, Democratic Socialist and New York State Representative 

56 
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,640 
 Sohran Mamdani has defeated the disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York City's 

57 
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,800 
 Democratic mayoral primary. 

58 
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,760 
 Cuomo conceded Tuesday night after Mamdani took a commanding lead, with over 43 percent 

59 
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,440 
 of voters in the ranked-choice election. 

60 
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,240 
 Mamdani took to the stage Tuesday night as supporters burst into applause at his election 

61 
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240 
 party. 

62 
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:42,280 
 Today, eight months after launching this campaign, with the vision of a city that every 

63 
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,680 
 New Yorker could afford, we have won. 

64 
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,280 
 If elected in November's general election, Mamdani would become the first Muslim mayor 

65 
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,520 
 of New York and, at 33 years old, its youngest mayor in over a century. 

66 
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:2,600 
 We'll have more on Mamdani's historic victory after headlines. 

67 
00:05:2,600 --> 00:05:7,280 
 A federal court in New York has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return 

68 
00:05:7,280 --> 00:05:11,240 
 of a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador last month, despite the 

69 
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,000 
 same court instructing Trump officials in May not to remove the man from the U.S. 

70 
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,660 
 The Trump administration admitted it had removed Jordan Elsalmaran due to a confluence of administrative 

71 
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,780 
 errors," unquote. 

72 
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,300 
 This comes as immigration rights advocates nationwide are speaking up against the growing 

73 
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,420 
 collaboration between local police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as the Trump administration 

74 
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,080 
 intensifies its mass raids. 

75 
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,740 
 In Los Angeles, community organizers rallied on Tuesday, decrying LAPD's complicity with 

76 
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740 
 ICE. 

77 
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,500 
 This is Ron Gochas, member of the grassroots community defense group Unión del Barrio, 

78 
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,820 
 speaking outside the LAPD headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. 

79 
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,980 
 He showed footage of police officers standing in line with ICE agents during a recent raid. 

80 
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:1,540 
 I think the world is seeing the repression that we're living in Los Angeles, where people 

81 
00:06:1,540 --> 00:06:2,940 
 are kidnapping our community. 

82 
00:06:2,940 --> 00:06:5,940 
 There are mass gunmen running around, kidnapping people. 

83 
00:06:5,940 --> 00:06:11,060 
 And today, the police department collaborated, participated, protected these operations. 

84 
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,620 
 So that's why we're all here today, to denounce the police department. 

85 
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,260 
 This city is supposed to be a sanctuary city, but today it was proven that it is not. 

86 
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,820 
 To see our extended interview with Ron Gochas, go to democracynow.org. 

87 
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,740 
 Nearly 60,000 people are believed to be currently detained at ICE jails across the country, 

88 
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,740 
 a record high, as Trump adviser Stephen Miller announced Operation At-Large, a program to 

89 
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:43,020 
 aggressively target immigrants, with a daily quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day. 

90 
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,860 
 A damning new report has exposed Stephen Miller's financial interests and palantir, a tech and 

91 
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,620 
 AI company that stands to make millions of dollars off Trump's immigration raids and 

92 
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,900 
 mass detention. 

93 
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:3,380 
 The public report says Miller owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in assets at Palantir, 

94 
00:07:3,380 --> 00:07:7,620 
 which has been tapped by the Trump administration to compile information on U.S. residents for 

95 
00:07:7,620 --> 00:07:12,700 
 a master database based on tax returns, immigration records and more. 

96 
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,240 
 Palantir also has a $30 million contract with ICE to provide almost real-time visibility 

97 
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800 
 into immigrants' movements. 

98 
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,200 
 Palantir was co-founded by the far-right, Trump-supporting billionaire tech investor 

99 
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,020 
 Peter Thiel. 

100 
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,000 
 The chair of the Senate Health Committee has called on a panel of vaccine advisers to delay 

101 
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,960 
 plans to meet this week, after accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, 

102 
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,240 
 Jr., of stacking the panel with unqualified members and vocal vaccine critics. 

103 
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,920 
 Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who has spent decades promoting 

104 
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,000 
 vaccines for children, wrote that the group Kennedy appointed lacks experience studying 

105 
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,040 
 microbiology, epidemiology or immunology. 

106 
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:1,200 
 Cassidy infamously voted to confirm RFK, Jr. in February, despite Kennedy's long history 

107 
00:08:1,200 --> 00:08:5,720 
 of promoting public health conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine disinformation. 

108 
00:08:5,720 --> 00:08:9,920 
 On Tuesday, RFK, Jr. appeared before a House subcommittee, where he was grilled over his 

109 
00:08:9,920 --> 00:08:15,520 
 pledge to Senator Cassidy that he would not change the makeup of the vaccine advisory panel. 

110 
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,320 
 This is Democratic Congressmember Kim Schrier of Washington. 

111 
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,460 
 You lied to Senator Cassidy. 

112 
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,360 
 You have lied to the American people. 

113 
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,680 
 You have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years. 

114 
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,920 
 And I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a 

115 
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,960 
 vaccine-preventable illness at your feet. 

116 
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,020 
 In Kenya, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Nairobi and other cities 

117 
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,060 
 to mark a grim first anniversary of a youth-led uprising against high taxes, poor economic 

118 
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,100 
 conditions, and the rule of President William Ruto that was met by massive police violence 

119 
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100 
 last year. 

120 
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:0,120 
 For me, today means that revolution is coming to Kenya. 

121 
00:09:0,120 --> 00:09:6,580 
 And I pray that this is a day that will change everything, that Ruto will go today. 

122 
00:09:6,580 --> 00:09:11,180 
 In response to this week's peaceful protests, Kenyan police blocked major roads leading to 

123 
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,620 
 Nairobi's central business district and draped government buildings with razor wire. 

124 
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580 
 The brutal crackdown on protests a year ago killed at least 60 people, with hundreds more 

125 
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580 
 injured. 

126 
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,220 
 And Nigeria's government posthumously pardoned nine activists, known as the Ogoni Nine, who 

127 
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,200 
 were hanged in 1995 after a sham military trial that targeted peaceful protesters demanding 

128 
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,340 
 an end to the oil drilling and environmental damage in the Niger Delta. 

129 
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,780 
 Among those receiving a pardon is the late Ken Saro-Wiwa, who led the movement against 

130 
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,260 
 the Shell Oil Company's practices in Ogoniland. 

131 
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,240 
 In a statement to Amnesty International's Nigeria director said the pardons fall far 

132 
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,260 
 short of the justice of the Ogoni Nine need and deserve. 

133 
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,460 
 He added, quote, the execution of these activists nearly 30 years ago is given the Nigerian 

134 
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:1,180 
 government and oil companies, including Shell, license to crack down on protests and intimidate 

135 
00:10:1,180 --> 00:10:6,620 
 people in the Niger Delta who've been demanding justice and an end to their toxic pollution, 

136 
00:10:6,620 --> 00:10:7,620 
 unquote. 

137 
00:10:7,620 --> 00:10:14,700

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,880
